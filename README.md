#Cosmic Structure - SS24 - Universit√§t Wien
This is a repository that contains the code used to produce the results highlighted in the article written and submitted as the focus project of the Cosmic Structure module from the University of Vienna SS24. 

This contains an interactive python notebook that generates simple three-dimensional simulations with different existing topological characterisations of the initial perturbations to further evaluate its impact in the production of large-scale structures.
